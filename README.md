# Game: "Chicken Clicker"

The game was implemented in Unity using C#.
I also drew all the graphics for the game.

### A small demonstration of the game:

Flowers, after purchase, begin to bring a certain number of monetary units, depending on the level of the flower.

In the "https://anikin02.itch.io/chickenclicker" there is an .apk file for installing the game on android.
